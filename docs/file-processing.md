# File Processing

This document covers how files are handled in two contexts: chat file uploads
(user-facing) and RAG document ingestion (admin/CLI).

## Chat File Uploads

When a user uploads a file in the chat interface, the following pipeline runs:

### Flow

```
1. Upload     POST /api/v1/files/upload
               |
2. Validate    Check MIME type against allowed list + enforce size limit
               |
3. Classify    Determine file_type: "image", "pdf", "docx", "text"
               |
4. Parse       Extract text content (images skip this step)
               |
5. Store       Save file to media/{user_id}/ via FileStorageService
               |
6. Record      Create ChatFile row in database
               |
7. Link        When message is sent, ChatFile is attached via message_id FK
               |
8. Display     Frontend shows images as thumbnails, documents as badges
```

### Supported File Types

| Category | MIME Types | Extensions | Processing |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Images** | image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif | .jpg, .png, .webp, .gif | Stored as-is. Sent to LLM as `BinaryContent` for vision analysis. |
| **PDF** | application/pdf | .pdf | Text extracted via configured PDF parser. Appended to prompt as context. |
| **DOCX** | application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document | .docx | Paragraphs extracted via `python-docx`. Appended to prompt as context. |
| **Text** | text/plain, text/markdown | .txt, .md | UTF-8 decoded directly. Appended to prompt as context. |

### PDF Parser Selection (Chat)

PDFs are processed using PyMuPDF. This is a local parser that requires no API
key and handles text extraction, table detection, and block-level parsing.

### Size Limits

- Maximum file size: `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB` environment variable (default: **50 MB**)
- The limit is enforced server-side after reading the file content.

### Storage

Files are saved by `FileStorageService` to the `media/` directory:

```
media/
  {user_id}/
    document.pdf
    screenshot.png
    ...
```

### ChatFile Model

The `ChatFile` database model tracks uploaded files:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Primary key |
| `user_id` | UUID/FK | Owner (used for access control) |
| `filename` | String | Original filename |
| `mime_type` | String | MIME type (e.g. `application/pdf`) |
| `size` | Integer | File size in bytes |
| `storage_path` | String | Relative path in storage |
| `file_type` | String | Classified type: `image`, `pdf`, `docx`, `text` |
| `parsed_content` | Text | Extracted text content (NULL for images) |
| `message_id` | UUID/FK | Linked message (set when message is sent) |
| `created_at` | DateTime | Upload timestamp |

### Ownership & Access

- Only the file owner can download their files (`GET /files/{id}`).
- The `FileUploadService.get_user_file()` method compares `chat_file.user_id`
  against the requesting user's ID. Returns `NotFoundError` on mismatch.
- There is no admin override -- admins cannot access other users' chat files
  through the file API.
